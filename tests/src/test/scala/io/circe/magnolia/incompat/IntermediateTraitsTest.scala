  * This is another semantical difference from shapeless-based circe derivation.
  * Shapeless generic skips intermediate traits/abstract classes and forms a coproduct of only leaf types.
  * This makes perfect sense for many scenarios, JSON included.
  *
  * Magnolia, on the other hand, dispatches through all intermediate types.
  * For encoding it's not that bad, but for decoding it's a showstopper. See tests.
